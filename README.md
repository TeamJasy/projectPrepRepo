### Cooperation Plan 
Strengths 
Stepehen: Overall structure and HTML.  
Joraya: Outlining JS, styling, enjoys the more monotonous parts of coding.  
Yari: Organized, CSS, jack of all trades, and research.  
Adrian: Enjoys JavaScript.  

Breaking the teams down into pairs of two to complement eachothers strengths and weaknesses.  

Places to improve as a group  
More practice at JavaScript, practice with event listener. X2  
Need practice display flex rule in CSS.  
Practice with functions.  
More variety in the way we display our pages.
When, where, and why to use math functions.    

Team internal stand ups before doing any work.  

### Conflict Plan  
NO FISTS  
One on one approach to start, if the issue can't be resolved escalate to the group.  
In each morning's stand-up we can check in on how everyone is doing, and address any team-wide issues we have.  

One on one approach to reset boundaries is having too much influence on the project.  
Worst-case scenario each person is set with clear boundaries that they have control over.  

Treat this as a learning experience. We are here to learn, and practice our skills however we can. One of the best ways  to do that is by teaching.  

We'll use the same approach as someone taking too much control. With an emphasis on keeping people accountable in the morning meetings.  

We'll only escalate if we can't solve our problems one on one.  

### Communication Plan  

Team wide 9-6 PST, with anything else coordinated beforehand.  

We'll use Slack for communication.  

50 minutes, 10 off for break times. Hour long lunch breaks.  

Ask for help! As team if we're falling behind we will communicate with TA's.  

Unless otherwise coordinated we are only working 9-6 PST.  

The morning stand-up we will check-in on each member and see how they are doing.  

### Work Plan  

Meetings in the morning we will identify and delegate key tasks to be accomplished. 
End of day meetings to see what is achieved, and where to go from there.  
github project manager(TBD)  

### Git Process  

index.html and about us will live on github  

4 branches off of the Dev branch for each individual person.  

The whole team will review pull requests at the end of the day during the afternoon meeting.  

Anyone can merge the pull requests.  

Merges at the end of the day after afternoon meetings.
